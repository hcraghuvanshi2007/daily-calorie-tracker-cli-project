# Why I Made This?
This project is part of my course around Python programming and problem solving.
It was designed to help students gain familiarity with user inputs, data manipulation, condition checks, and file handling in Python.

# Files Included:
tracker.py — Main Python script with the calorie tracker program.
calorie_log_<timestamp>.txt — Any session logs saved by the program.
